For this project, you will be building a Chrome Extension that enables autocomplete for text fields on any website. Imagine you are writing a blog, filling out a form, or writing anything on a website, and you have an AI copilot to suggest completions for all the text you write, similar to what Cursor does with code.

### Project Requirements:

​- Display inline text completions while the user is typing
- ​Complete the text when the user hits tab
- Handle edge cases like scrolling, text selection, and cursor position
- ​Work across sites without breaking their existing functionality

### Future Challenges:
- Ensure minimal latency in the AI responses
- Handle focus, selection, and undo/redo functionality
- Perfectly match the textarea's font, size, and position
